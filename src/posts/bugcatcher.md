This is my first attempt at writing [one game a month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/). It's a turn-based
dungeon crawler in the style of traditional roguelikes. All the characters in the game are bugs. Each bug
has an ability and combat stats. You can "channel" a bug and gain access to its ability and stats.
